#A simple calaulator library written in ruby.

Uses **BEDMAS** order of operations.

####Executing
To **try out** the library execute the command 'ruby init.rb', you can give it
lines of input and when you quit it will process it and return a result.

If you wish to use in your own project, you will want to require ether the
calculator or expression_builder class. You can achive the same from both
but the expression_builder provides an interface to simplyfi using the
calculator library.
